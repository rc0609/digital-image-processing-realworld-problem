## Edge Detection Basic
 (a) Load the dog.png image and convert it to grayscale. Apply the Roberts operator.
 (b) Repeat the process using the Prewitt and Sobel operators.
 (c) Compare the edge maps generated by each operator.

## Real-World Example- Removing Snow from an Image
(a) Load an image affected by snow (snow image is provided).
(b) Convert the image to grayscale and apply Sobel edge detection. 
(c) Apply a 5x5 and 7x7 median filter to the grayscale image to reduce snow-related noise.
(d) Repeat the Sobel edge detection on the filtered image.
(e) Experiment with a 7x7 median filter.

## Real-World Example- Removing Water Droplets from an Image
 (a) Select an image affected by water droplets (water droplet image).
 (b) Apply Sobel edge detection to the original grayscale image and discuss the impact of water droplets on edge detection.
 (c) Use a 5x5 median filter to reduce noise caused by water droplets.
 (d) Apply a Gaussian smoothing filter to further reduce smaller droplets.
 (e) Modify to apply a 7x7 median filter and a Gaussian smoothing filter after.
 (f) Apply Sobel edge detection after filtering to evaluate the improvement in edge clarity.
 (g) Experiment with unsharp masking to enhance edge details in the image.
